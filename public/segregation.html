      <h1>Waste Segregation: Importance and Methods</h1>
      <p>
        Segregation of waste is the process of separating different types of
        waste materials for proper disposal, recycling, or treatment. Effective
        waste segregation is essential for maintaining environmental
        sustainability, enhancing recycling efforts, and ensuring the safe
        handling of hazardous materials. Waste is generally categorized into
        various types like organic, recyclable, hazardous, and non-recyclable.
        Segregating waste at the source—households, businesses, and
        industries—plays a crucial role in reducing environmental impact and
        improving waste management systems.
      </p>
      <h2>Importance of Waste Segregation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Promotes Recycling and Resource Recovery</strong>: Segregation
          is vital for recycling efforts because different materials require
          distinct processes for reprocessing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prevents Environmental Pollution</strong>: Improper waste
          disposal can lead to serious environmental issues, such as soil and
          water contamination and air pollution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improves Efficiency of Waste Management Systems</strong>:
          Segregating waste enhances the overall efficiency of waste management
          systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Encourages Sustainability and Reduces Waste</strong>: Through
          waste segregation, the amount of waste destined for landfills is
          reduced, which directly contributes to a lower environmental
          footprint.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Ways to Segregate Waste</h2>
      <p>
        Proper segregation starts at the source, which could be homes,
        businesses, or institutions. Waste should be separated into specific
        categories for efficient disposal and treatment.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Separation into Dry and Wet Waste</strong>: Dry waste includes
          items like paper, plastics, glass, and metals that can be recycled.
          Wet waste comprises organic matter like food scraps and yard waste,
          which can be composted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Categorizing Recyclable and Non-Recyclable Waste</strong>:
          Recyclables, such as plastics, metals, and glass, should be collected
          separately from non-recyclables like contaminated packaging or certain
          types of single-use plastics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Segregating Hazardous Waste</strong>: Hazardous waste,
          including e-waste, chemicals, batteries, and medical waste, requires
          special handling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Organic Waste Segregation for Composting</strong>: Organic
          waste like food scraps, garden clippings, and even soiled paper
          products should be collected separately for composting.
        </li>
        </ul>
