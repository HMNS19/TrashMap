        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Real-Time Geolocation</h3>
          <p>
            The system will utilize GPS to display the nearest available
            dustbins to users. This feature encourages users to dispose of waste
            properly by guiding them to designated disposal sites, reducing
            littering and promoting cleaner environments.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Black Site Reporting</h3>
          <p>
            Users can report "black sites" or locations where garbage
            accumulation is common, such as illegal dumping areas or overflowing
            bins. This alerts local authorities or waste management teams,
            enabling them to take swift action to clean these areas and prevent
            further waste build-up.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Garbage Pickup Scheduling</h3>
          <p>
            The platform will allow users to schedule garbage pickups from their
            homes or businesses, reducing the likelihood of missed collections.
            Additionally, the system will optimize waste collection routes based
            on user inputs, enhancing efficiency and lowering fuel consumption
            for garbage trucks.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Reward System</h3>
          <p>
            To incentivize responsible waste disposal, users will earn points
            each time they use the app's services, such as reporting black sites
            or properly disposing of waste. Once users accumulate 1,000 points,
            they can redeem them for rewards like AICTE points (for students and
            professionals) or other benefits. This gamification approach
            encourages continuous engagement and fosters a culture of
            sustainability.

          <h3>Enhanced Community Cleanliness</h3>
          <p>
            With features like real-time geolocation and black site reporting,

          <h3>Promotes Responsible Behavior</h3>
          <p>
            The reward system not only encourages individuals to actively
            participate in proper waste disposal but also offers tangible
            incentives, motivating ongoing use of the system.

          <p>
            By integrating efficient waste collection methods and preventing
            litter through geolocation and reporting, the system contributes
            significantly to environmental sustainability efforts and supports
            cleaner, greener communities.
